<h1>BORED</h1><h2>by : Laufey</h2>
<p> Why don't we?<br>
    Call it for what it is<br>
    Can't rememver the last time we kiss<br>
    And it tickle my heart,<br>
    I think that its best that we spent time apart 
</p>
<p> I just yawn<br>
    Listening to you<br>
    Talk about yourself again<br>
    And again 
</p>
<p> I'm bored <br>
    Bored of this love<br>
    Oh, I'm bored<br>
    Bored of this talk<br>
    And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting<br>
    Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening<br>
    Don't mean to walk out the door<br>
    But baby, I'm bored<br>
    (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) ooh-ooh 
</p>
<p> Did you know (did you know)<br>
    I wept in my room last night?<br>
    Bet you didn't know you make me cry<br>
    'Cause you're so self possessed<br>
    Charming at first, but you've made me depressed<br>
    So I'm leaving in the morning
</p>
<p>'Cause I'm bored<br>
    Bored of this love<br>
    Oh, I'm bored<br>
    Bored of this talk<br>
    And maybe you're just way too plain to be interesting<br>
    Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening<br>
    Don't mean to walk out the door<br>
    But baby, I'm bored
</p>
<p> You followed me out and said, "Darling don't leave"<br>
    Your passionate monologue woke up the street<br>
    "I'll marry you someday, you're perfect for me"<br>
    I got in my car just to drown out your plea
</p>
<p>'Cause I'm bored<br>
    Bored of this love<br>
    Oh, I'm bored<br>
    Bored of this talk<br>
    And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting<br>
    Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening<br>
    Don't mean to walk out the door<br>
    But baby, I'm bored (ooh-ooh)<br>
    Ooh-ooh, ooh (ooh-ooh, ooh)<br>
    (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
